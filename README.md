Spine 
A distraction-free, browser-based PDF reader contained in a single file.
Philosophy
Reading on a screen often feels cluttered. ZenReader strips away the UI, leaving only the paper, the text, and a realistic turning animation. It mimics the tactile feel of a physical book while providing the digital tools you actually need.
